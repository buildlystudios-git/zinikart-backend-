# ZiniKart Backend Project Plan

This document tracks backend requirements, architecture decisions, and implementation planning for **ZiniKart**, a multi-vendor ecommerce platform for mobile phones, mobile accessories, and gadgets.

The backend is based on **Payload CMS v3** and the **Payload Ecommerce Template**. The immediate focus is the backend app only: Payload collections, access control, APIs, workflows, admin capabilities, background jobs, integrations, and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

## Product Summary

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Project name | ZiniKart |
| Product type | Multi-vendor ecommerce platform |
| Primary categories | Mobile phones, mobile accessories, gadgets |
| Backend base | Payload CMS v3 + Payload Ecommerce Template |
| Primary clients | Customer app, retailer app, delivery partner app, admin panel |
| MVP priority | Backend architecture, collections, APIs, workflows, admin operations |

## Applications

| Application | Users | Backend Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer App | Customers | OTP login, browse/search products, wishlist, cart, checkout, orders, tracking, profile |
| Retailer App | Sellers/retailers | OTP login, product pricing/stock, accept/reject orders, packing, pickup handover, earnings |
| Delivery Partner App | Delivery executives | Registration, approval, OTP login, online/offline, delivery requests, pickup OTP, COD handling, earnings |
| Admin Panel | Platform administrators | Manage users, retailers, delivery partners, catalog, orders, payments, coupons, notifications, analytics |

## Tech Stack

| Area | Choice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CMS / Backend | Payload CMS v3 | Admin panel, collections, access control, REST/GraphQL/custom APIs |
| Base Template | Payload Ecommerce Template | Reuse products, variants, carts, addresses, orders, transactions where practical |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Current Payload adapter uses isolated `payload` schema |
| Mobile Apps | React Native | Planned separately; backend should expose stable APIs |
| Auth | Mobile OTP auth via Twilio | Primary auth for customer, retailer, delivery partner apps |
| Admin Auth | Payload admin auth | Keep email/password initially unless changed later |
| Payments | Razorpay MVP | PRD also mentions PhonePe/Cashfree as future supported gateways |
| COD | Supported | Requires payment state and delivery partner COD workflow |
| Push Notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging | Used for order, retailer, delivery, promotional alerts |
| Email | Provider TBD | Use jobs/background tasks |
| SMS | Twilio | OTP and optional critical SMS alerts |
| Maps | Google Maps | Rendering/navigation only; app opens external Google Maps for route navigation |

## Existing Template Assets To Reuse

| Existing Area | Reuse Level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `users` collection | High | Extend roles and add mobile OTP fields |
| Access helpers | High | Extend for retailer/delivery ownership |
| Ecommerce plugin products | Medium | Use as catalog base; separate seller-specific offers/stock |
| Ecommerce plugin variants | Medium | Useful for phone/accessory variants if needed |
| Ecommerce plugin carts | Medium/High | Reuse where possible, but seller-wise pricing may require customization |
| Ecommerce plugin orders | Medium | Extend lifecycle, payment type, seller/delivery fields |
| Ecommerce plugin transactions | Medium | Store Razorpay/PhonePe/Cashfree/COD metadata |
| Ecommerce plugin addresses | High | Add coordinates, landmark, delivery instructions |
| Media collection | High | Product, category, banner, retailer, document images |
| Categories collection | High | Extend for subcategories and display metadata |
| OpenAPI setup | High | Keep Swagger docs for custom APIs |
| Web storefront UI | Low | Treat as reference/demo only; mobile APIs are primary |

## Current Template Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Planned Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Template is web-storefront oriented | Does not directly satisfy mobile PRD | Build mobile/backend custom endpoints |
| No retailer entity | Cannot model shops/seller comparison | Add `retailers` collection |
| No seller product/offers model | Cannot support multiple sellers per product | Add `sellerProducts` collection |
| Global product inventory | Wrong for multi-vendor stock | Stock lives on `sellerProducts` |
| No delivery partner entity | Cannot handle delivery workflows | Add `deliveryPartners` collection |
| Basic order statuses | PRD needs detailed lifecycle | Override/extend order statuses |
| Stripe payments | PRD wants Razorpay, PhonePe, Cashfree, COD | Implement Razorpay first, gateway abstraction later |
| No pickup OTP | Handover cannot be verified | Add pickup code/OTP on order or delivery assignment |
| No earnings/settlements | Retailer/delivery apps need earnings | Add earnings/settlement models |
| No wishlist | Customer PRD requires wishlist | Add `wishlists` or wishlist relation |
| No brand model | Filters/search need brand | Add `brands` collection |
| No background jobs | Notifications and retries need async processing | Use Payload jobs/background task layer |

## Order Lifecycle

Client PRD lifecycle:

```txt
order_received -> preparing -> packed -> ready_for_pickup -> picked_up -> out_for_delivery -> delivered
```

Operational lifecycle with actors:

| Status | Actor | Meaning | Side Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `order_received` | System | Order created after payment/COD confirmation | Notify retailer/customer |
| `accepted` | Retailer | Retailer accepts order | Confirm fulfillment |
| `rejected` | Retailer | Retailer rejects order | Trigger refund/reassignment/cancel flow |
| `preparing` | Retailer | Retailer preparing order | Notify customer |
| `packed` | Retailer | Order packed | Notify customer/admin |
| `ready_for_pickup` | Retailer | Ready for delivery pickup | Generate pickup OTP/code; notify delivery/admin |
| `delivery_assigned` | Admin/system | Partner assigned | Notify delivery partner |
| `picked_up` | Delivery partner | Pickup verified and collected | Start delivery tracking |
| `out_for_delivery` | Delivery partner | Partner is en route to customer | Notify customer |
| `delivered` | Delivery partner | Order completed | Close assignment, queue earnings |
| `cancelled` | Customer/admin/system | Order cancelled | Refund/release inventory if needed |
| `failed` | System/payment | Payment/order failure | Notify customer/admin |
| `refunded` | Admin/payment | Refund completed | Close payment issue |

## Payment Plan

| Payment Method | MVP Support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Razorpay | Yes | First online gateway |
| Cash on Delivery | Yes | Requires COD collection workflow |
| PhonePe | Later | Keep gateway abstraction extensible |
| Cashfree | Later | Keep gateway abstraction extensible |

### Payment States

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | Awaiting payment |
| `success` | Payment completed |
| `failed` | Payment failed |
| `refunded` | Amount refunded |
| `cod_pending` | COD expected from customer |
| `cod_collected` | COD collected by delivery partner |
| `cod_settled` | COD settled internally |

### Online Payment Flow

| Step | Backend Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Create payment order | Create Razorpay order from server-side cart totals |
| Open gateway | Mobile app handles Razorpay checkout |
| Verify transaction | Backend verifies Razorpay signature/payment |
| Create order | Backend creates order after verification |
| Notify actors | Queue customer/retailer notifications |

### COD Flow

| Step | Backend Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Place order | Validate cart and address |
| Confirm COD | Create order with COD payment state |
| Delivery collection | Delivery partner marks COD collected |
| Delivery completion | Mark delivered only after COD confirmation if required |

## Delivery And Tracking Strategy

| Requirement | MVP Plan |
| --- | --- |
| Live order tracking | Status updates plus location polling |
| Delivery assignment | Manual admin assignment first; auto assignment later |
| Instant alerts | Firebase push notifications |
| Status sync | Apps poll order detail or refresh after push notification |
| Route navigation | Mobile app opens Google Maps |
| Location data | Delivery app posts lat/lng periodically |

For MVP, avoid Socket.IO/realtime servers unless absolutely needed. Push notifications plus polling can satisfy most "realtime" user expectations at lower complexity.

## Pickup Verification

| Item | Plan |
| --- | --- |
| Pickup OTP/code | Generate when order becomes `ready_for_pickup` or assignment is created |
| Verification actor | Retailer verifies code shown/provided by delivery partner |
| Result | Status moves to `picked_up` and handover timestamp is stored |
| Audit | Store verification event in order status history |

## Background Jobs And Notifications

Use background jobs for slow, retryable, or external side effects. Keep critical order/payment writes synchronous.

| Job Type | Trigger | Action | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OTP SMS | OTP request | Send/verify through Twilio | P0 |
| Customer push | Order status/payment changes | FCM push to customer | P0 |
| Retailer push | New order/ready actions | FCM push to retailer users | P0 |
| Delivery push | Delivery request/assignment | FCM push to delivery partner | P0 |
| Promotional push | Admin campaign | FCM push to selected audience | P1 |
| Email notification | Order/invoice/refund events | Send email via provider | P1 |
| Order timeout | Scheduled job | Detect stale retailer/delivery acceptance | P1/P2 |
| Earnings credit | Delivered order | Calculate retailer/delivery earnings | P1 |
| Settlement processing | Scheduled/manual | Mark settlements/withdrawals | P2 |
| AI autofill | Vendor product draft | Generate product metadata suggestions | P2 |

### Notification Audiences

| Notification Type | Audience |
| --- | --- |
| OTP received | Customer/retailer/delivery partner |
| Order placed | Customer |
| New order received | Retailer |
| Pickup assigned | Retailer |
| Delivery request | Delivery partner |
| Order shipped/out for delivery | Customer |
| Delivered | Customer |
| Earnings credited | Retailer/delivery partner |
| Promotional | All users or segmented users |

## Notification Model

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `recipient` | User receiving notification |
| `audienceRole` | Optional role segment |
| `channel` | `push`, `email`, `sms`, `in_app` |
| `type` | `order_placed`, `delivery_request`, etc. |
| `title` | Short title |
| `message` | Notification body |
| `data` | JSON navigation payload |
| `status` | `queued`, `sent`, `failed`, `cancelled` |
| `attempts` | Retry count |
| `lastError` | Last failure |
| `sentAt` | Dispatch timestamp |

## API Strategy

Use Payload REST for simple admin-safe CRUD. Use custom endpoints for mobile workflows, payments, OTP, status transitions, and side effects.

| Area | API Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth | Custom mobile endpoints | Twilio OTP + Payload-compatible token |
| Catalog | Custom read endpoints + Payload REST | Seller pricing must be resolved server-side |
| Search | Custom endpoint | Keyword/category/brand suggestions |
| Wishlist | Custom or Payload REST | Enforce current customer ownership |
| Cart | Plugin endpoints or custom wrapper | Must validate seller product availability |
| Checkout | Custom service endpoint | Coupon, tax, delivery charges, payment type |
| Razorpay | Custom endpoints | Create order and verify payment |
| COD | Custom checkout/order endpoints | COD state transitions |
| Order status | Custom endpoints | Enforce allowed transitions by role |
| Retailer orders | Custom endpoints | Accept/reject/update status |
| Delivery assignment | Custom endpoints | Accept/reject pickup/delivery actions |
| Tracking | Custom endpoint | Post delivery location; read latest tracking |
| Earnings | Custom read endpoints | Aggregates for retailer/delivery app |
| Withdrawals | Custom/Payload REST | Delivery partner withdrawal requests |
| Notifications | Jobs + admin endpoints | Apps should not directly send system notifications |

| Catalog MVP | Customer can browse/search phones/accessories/gadgets with seller pricing |
| Wishlist MVP | Customer can save/remove/move products to cart |
| Cart MVP | Customer can manage seller-specific cart items and totals |
| Payment MVP | Razorpay and COD order flows work |
| Order MVP | Order lifecycle works from received to delivered |
| Retailer Ops MVP | Retailer accepts/rejects, prepares, packs, marks ready |
| Delivery MVP | Partner accepts request, verifies pickup OTP, delivers order, handles COD |
| Notification MVP | Key lifecycle events send queued push notifications |
| Admin MVP | Admin can manage users, retailers, delivery partners, orders, catalog, coupons |

## Open Decisions

| Decision | Options | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seller inventory model | Product stock vs `sellerProducts` | Use `sellerProducts` |
| Order item storage | Embedded in orders vs separate collection | Use plugin order items initially; separate if reporting becomes painful |
| Admin auth | Email/password vs OTP | Keep Payload admin email/password initially |
| OTP provider | Twilio Verify vs custom OTP | Use Twilio Verify |
| First payment gateway | Razorpay vs generic abstraction first | Implement Razorpay service with generic interface shape |
| COD settlement | Manual vs automated | Manual/admin MVP, automate later |
| Delivery assignment | Manual vs auto | Manual/admin MVP, auto later |
| Tracking transport | Polling/push vs Socket.IO | Polling + push MVP |
| File storage | S3 vs Cloudinary | AWS S3 if AWS deployment is primary |
| Search | Database search vs external search | Start with DB search; external search later |
| Reviews/ratings | MVP vs later | Later unless client insists |

## Security Requirements

| Requirement | Backend Plan |
| --- | --- |
| JWT authentication | Payload-compatible JWT/session for mobile APIs |
| HTTPS | Required in production |
| OTP expiry | Twilio Verify expiry |
| Rate limiting | OTP and sensitive endpoints |
| Role-based access | Payload access functions and custom endpoint checks |
| API authentication | Bearer token for mobile APIs |
| SQL injection prevention | Use Payload/structured queries, avoid raw SQL unless parameterized |
| XSS protection | Sanitize/admin-controlled rich text where exposed |
| Document protection | Delivery licenses/bank details require restricted access |
| Payment verification | Server-side signature verification |
| Auditability | Status events for important order/delivery/payment changes |

## Backend Deliverables

| Deliverable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| REST/custom APIs | Mobile app workflows |
| Authentication system | OTP, JWT/session, roles |
| Database schema | Payload collections and generated types |
| Admin APIs/panel | Payload admin + custom admin workflows |
| Payment integration | Razorpay first, COD support |
| Tracking system | Polling location updates and status timeline |
| Notification system | FCM/email/SMS jobs |
| Swagger documentation | Keep custom APIs OpenAPI-compatible |
| Postman collection | Later, after endpoint stabilization |
| Production deployment setup | AWS, storage, env, logs, monitoring |

## Engineering Principles

- Keep the Payload admin panel useful for operations from day one.
- Use Payload collections for data ownership, admin screens, and schema clarity.
- Use custom endpoints for mobile workflows and state transitions.
- Put business logic in `services/`, not UI components.
- Avoid uncontrolled direct status updates from apps.
- Record lifecycle events instead of overwriting history.
- Use `overrideAccess: false` when operating on behalf of a user.
- Pass `req` through nested Payload operations in hooks/services.
- Keep background jobs idempotent and retry-safe.
- Start with polling + push before adding realtime infrastructure.
- Keep the gateway/payment code abstract enough to add PhonePe/Cashfree later.

## Immediate Next Steps

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Confirm `sellerProducts` as retailer-specific price/stock model |
| 2 | Confirm admin auth remains Payload email/password |
| 3 | Finalize order/payment status enums |
| 4 | Design OTP auth fields and Twilio service |
| 5 | Design `retailers` and `deliveryPartners` collections |
| 6 | Design `brands`, product specs, and seller comparison fields |
| 7 | Design order lifecycle/status event model |
| 8 | Create implementation tickets phase by phase |
